What is Mockdoor
==============
Mockdoor is fundamentally a mocking and debugging service designed for a large number of microservices and environments. What makes Mockdoor different than the many other mocking services that exist its its self learning, multi tenancy and scalability features. With self learning and multi tenancy even a mature existing project can be brought in and mocked out in a few minutes.
